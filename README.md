# TuxRacer
Tux penguin race game with betting.

To get this to run in windows 10

1. download python 3.8 from the Windows store. 

2. install pip with: python3 get-pip.py

3. make sure it's updated with: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

4. install pygame with: python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

if all these commands have completed successfully then you should be able to run the game with python3 ./tuxracer.py



I have not documented the code very well. 

I made this game for a project in school.
